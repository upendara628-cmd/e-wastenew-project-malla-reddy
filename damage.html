        Informal e-waste processing exposes vulnerable individuals to hazardous chemicals like lead, mercury, and flame retardants. Consequences include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Severe respiratory problems and lung damage.</li>
        <li>Neurological effects such as memory loss and developmental delays in children.</li>

        Toxic fumes from burning e-waste contaminate the air, damaging nearby communities including schools and homes. Many affected populations lack access to healthcare and protective regulations.
